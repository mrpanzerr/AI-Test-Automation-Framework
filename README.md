# **AI-Test-Automation-Framework**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop an AI-driven framework that automates the generation and execution of test cases directly from user stories. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and integrating with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, the system will automatically generate test cases, execute them, and continuously improve through a self-learning mechanism.

## **Project Goals**

1. **NLP-Based Test Case Generation:**
   - Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine that can parse user stories and extract key elements such as actions, conditions, and expected outcomes.
   - Automatically generate structured test cases from these parsed user stories.

2. **Test Automation Framework:**
   - Implement an automation framework (e.g., using Selenium with Python) to execute the generated test cases on target software.
   - Ensure the automation framework can handle a variety of test cases and provide detailed execution reports.

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the execution of test cases whenever new code is committed.
   - Integrate automated testing into the development workflow, with notifications and reports generated for test results.

4. **Continuous Learning and Improvement:**
   - Implement a feedback loop where the AI model learns from failed test cases to improve the accuracy and relevance of future test case generation.
   - Continuously refine the NLP engine and test generation logic based on feedback and test results.

5. **Documentation and Accessibility:**
   - Document the entire project, including setup instructions, system architecture, and usage guidelines.
   - Ensure the project is accessible and easy to use by providing clear, concise documentation and an intuitive user interface.
